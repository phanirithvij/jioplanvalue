## TODO

- [ ] api method for phonepay or myjio plan list (see if website has plans listed)
    - [ ] phonepay has platform fee or 2 rs or so check if it is constant
- [ ] generalize to airtel as well
- [ ] sort by cheapest value, per gb etc.
- [ ] tui or web frontend to allow changing sort values
    - [ ] move away from python if tui
    - [ ] guess df can be jsoned and sent to client
    - [ ] sort by key in js or tui client lang (maybe go/rust)
- [ ] maybe notifications/reminders and link for the direct payment for plan (phonepay)
    - [ ] So an android app?
        - [ ] gotify ?
